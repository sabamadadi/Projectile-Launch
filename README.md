# Projectile-Physics-

A projectile has v0 = 2 km/s,

The position of target is (R,h) where R = 50 km & h = 2 km,

Finding theta in 3 different situations:
a) neglecting air resistance
b) taking into account air resistance with f = -bv & b = 0.01 N.s/m
c) also taking into account headwind v = -50 m/s
